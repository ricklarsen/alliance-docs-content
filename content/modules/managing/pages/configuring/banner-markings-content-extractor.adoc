= Configuring Banner Markings Extractor

The Banner Markings Extractor parses the text of PDFs, Microsoft Office documents, plain text files,
or any other file from which the Tika Transformer can extract text.
The {branding} default behavior is to apply high-water security settings when ingesting a document.
This is sufficient for documents with no security markings, but is incorrect when working with
classified documents that include security mark-up in the text.

The Banner Markings Extractor parses a banner marking and populates the values of security
attributes on the metacard of the ingested document. The extractor looks at the first non-blank
line of text in the document and tries to interpret it as a banner marking.
The interpretation of a banner marking is guided by DoD Instruction 5200.01
and the {branding} catalog taxonomy. The marking extractors
will attempt to get as much information from the banner marking as possible.
The attributes they attempt to extract are:

* Classification
* Releasibility
* Codewords
* Dissemination Controls
* Owner-Producer
* Classification System
* Special Access Program
* Atomic Energy Act
* DoD Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (DoD UCNI)
* Department of Energy (DOE) UCNI
* Foreign Government Information
* Other dissemination markings


[WARNING]
====
If other transformers or extractors have already assigned values to the metacard's
security attributes, and the markings extracted by Banner Markings Extractor
do not match them, the ingest will fail. This is done to prevent a data spill because
the correct markings cannot be determined by {branding}.
====

== Installing the Banner Markings Extractor

The Banner Markings Extractor is installed by default with a standard installation.

== Configuring the Banner Markings Extractor

The Banner Markings Extractor is not configurable.

[NOTE]
====
The Banner Markings Extractor looks at the first non-blank line of text in a document.
It does not look at subsequent lines. This is per the Code of Federal Regulations,
Title 32, Subtitle B, Chapter XX, Part 2001 , Subpart C, Section 2001.23:
_A single linear text string showing the overall classification and markings
shall be included in the first line of text ... ._
====

However, after installing the Banner Markings Extractor, check the configuration of the Metacard Attribute Security Policy Plugin
 and ensure the desired policy is configured. This is a typical (but not exhaustive configuration):

.[[_common_security_attribute_mappings]]Common Security Attribute Mappings
[cols="1m,1m,1m" options="header"]
|===
|Banner Marking Attribute
|Metacard Security Attribute
|Intersect or Union Attribute

|`security.classification`
|`classification`
|union

|`security.codewords`
|`SCIcontrols`
|union

|`security.releasability`
|`releasableTo`
|union
|===

These settings rename the security attributes used by the XACML policies and the Policy Decision Point (PDP).
If the attribute names are not changed,
the security policies would not work as expected.

[WARNING]
====
The Banner Markings Extractor transfers values from a banner marking to a
metacards. This does NOT imply that the {branding} will make correct policy decisions based
on those values. Changes to the XACML policy file or PDP configuration are typically necessary and are based on organizational needs.
