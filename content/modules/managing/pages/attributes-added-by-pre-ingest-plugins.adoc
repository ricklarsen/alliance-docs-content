= Attributes Added by Pre-Ingest Plugins

* The xref:architectures:plugins/default-attribute-plugin.adoc[Default Security Attribute Plugin] is a configurable plugin that maps system high user attribute values to metacard attribute values.
"System high user attributes" refers to the attributes on the ${branding}'s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain[Second-Level Domain] {external-link} user, who is defined in the `etc/users.attributes` file.
For example, if `https://localhost:8993` is the ${branding}'s domain name, then the `localhost` user has the system high user attributes.
See xref:architectures:plugins/default-attribute-plugin.adoc#_configuring_the_default_security_attribute_plugin[Configuring the Default Security Attribute Plugin] for configuration details.
Note that if security markings have already been applied to the metacard, the values will not be overridden by this plugin.
